We used the 7k Books with Metadata dataset on Kaggle as the foundation for populating our database. 
This dataset provides ISBNs, titles, authors, categories, ratings, and other metadata.

We developed DataLoader.java to handle importing the CSV file into our database.
Our DataLoader connects to the database** using JDBC, reads the CSV file containing book metadata,
parses fields for relevant data like  ISBN, title, authors, etc., 
inserts or updates books, handles authors by checking if an author already exists,
and many other vital functions to ensure the data is properly formatted and the tables are filled correctly.
