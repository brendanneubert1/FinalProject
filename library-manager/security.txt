Our approach for storing user's passwords securly is through a hashing algorithm BCrypt. This is an 
algorithm that does a one way hashing for the password the user entered to avoid storing password as plaintext
to avoid hacking. Even if identical plaintext passowrds are provided, they will be stored as different hashes.
When the password is entered on login screen, we supply this password and the hash is retrieved
from the database.Then, BCrypt compares  the password to the hash without revealing the plaintext.
